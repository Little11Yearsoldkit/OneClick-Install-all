# OneClick-Install-all
This is was my First Project the project was basicly aimmed for An Installer With A lot of executable files or Msi files, instead of Clicking the executable one by one you can now just click install.bat and all of the Executable opens up without clicking one by one executable.
this project Was Still in Prototype overall
